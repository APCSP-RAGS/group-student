    "# Brief Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with researching how to host a websocket in python. The two necessary modules were `asyncio`, which provides asynchronous I/O functionality, and `websockets`, which actually runs/serves the websocket. Using these modules, it was relatively easy to replace all the `print()` functions with `await websocket.send()`. The hardest part was to serve the websocket through Jupyter without issues. Jupyter doesn't run python the same way as if you were just running it normally through Bash shell, so we had to add the `nest_asyncio` module to fix some problems with asyncio looping. After a little more tweaking, we were finally able to get the websocket to work and close when the quiz finished.\n",

    "# ChatGPT Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code appears to be a simple WebSocket-based quiz game running in a Jupyter Notebook. Overall, it seems to be well-structured and functional. However, there are a few improvements and considerations you might want to take into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Error Handling</b>: You should consider adding error handling for cases where the WebSocket connection fails or other exceptions occur. This will make your code more robust and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Code Organization</b>: You might want to break down your code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, you can create a function to ask a single question, and another one to calculate the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hardcoded Values</b>: There are some hardcoded values in your code, such as the number of questions (5) and the server address (\"localhost\" and port 8765). It would be better to make these configurable options, either as function arguments or as constants at the beginning of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>User Experience</b>: Consider providing clearer instructions to the user and formatting the messages more neatly. For instance, you could provide a welcome message and display the question number to make the quiz more user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>User Input Sanitization</b>: Depending on the context in which this code will be used, you might want to add some input sanitization or validation to ensure that the responses received from the WebSocket client are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Logging</b>: Consider adding logging statements to help with debugging and monitoring."
